__This "Don't be a jerk" policy is a shortened, more casual version of the longer Code of Conduct policy. [Read full version](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick).__


TUNA prides itself on being an open, respectful, and inclusive community, so are other MirrorCon organizers. That means jerky behavior isn’t allowed at MirrorCon. Because we know that it’s not obvious to everyone, here’s a reminder of the things we don’t allow: jokes or offensive comments about sex/sexuality/race/religion/nationality/body size, showing porn in public, touching people uninvited, continuing to interact with someone after they’ve asked you to stop, or starting quarrals for someone's supporting or not supporting certain open source softwares. Continuous jerky behavior may result in getting expelled from the meeting.

If someone is bothering you, please tell MirrorCon Organizers immediately and they will take care of it. Wish you have an unforgettable experience at MirrorCon.
